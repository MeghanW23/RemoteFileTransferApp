# Remote File Transfer App 
This application transfer files to and from remote servers via a graphical user interface. It was designed to make the transfer of files to and from Boston Children's Hospital's High Performance Computing Cluster, E3, easier for those without a firm handle on command line file transfer tools like `rsync`.
